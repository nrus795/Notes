\section{Topic 1: Importance of Exponential Functions}
The Exponential function, written as either
\(\expfn{a}{x}\) or \(\expfn{a}{t}\) depending on whether it is \(f(t)\) or \(f(x)\),
has properties that make it mathematically unique.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The derivative (rate of change) of the exponential function is the exponential function itself. More generally, this is a function whose rate of change is proportional to the function itself.
          \begin{equation}
              \deriv{\expfn{a}{x}}{x} = a\expfn{a}{x}
              \label{eq:exp-deriv}
          \end{equation}
    \item The integral of the exponential function is also the exponential function itself.
          \begin{equation}
              \int \expfn{a}{x} \dif x = \frac{1}{a}\expfn{a}{x}
              \label{eq:exp-integral}
          \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
