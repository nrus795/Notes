# Introduction {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This is my "coursebook", or rather, a collection of notes for the course ELECTENG 332: Control Systems.  The notes are written in Quarto, a markdown-based document processor that supports LaTeX and code blocks, and requires this introduction file.

Please skip this bit, there's nothing to see here.
