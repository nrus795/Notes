## Topic 1: The Importance of the Exponential Function
The Exponential function, written as either $e^{ax}$ or $e^{at}$ depending on whether it is $f(t)$ or $f(x)$, has properties that make it mathematically unique.

1.  The derivative (rate of change) of the exponential function is the exponential function itself. More generally, this is a function whose rate of change is proportional to the function itself.


    ```{=latex}
    %| label: exp-derivative
    \begin{equation} 
    \label{eq:exp-derivative}     
    \dv{e^{ax}}{x} = a e^{ax} 
    \end{equation}
    ```


2.  The integral of the exponential function is also the exponential function itself.


    ```{=latex}
    %| label: exp-integral
    \begin{equation} 
    \label{eq:exp-integral}     
    \int e^{ax} \dd{x} = \frac{1}{a} e^{ax} 
    \end{equation}
    ```
