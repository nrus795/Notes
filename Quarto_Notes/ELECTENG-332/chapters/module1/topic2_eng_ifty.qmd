## Topic 2: The Concept of Engineering Infinity
Consider a signal $e^{-at}$. The time constant for this signal is $T = \frac{1}{a}$. Theoretically, the signal is meant to decay to zero as time approaches infinity, i.e.


```{=latex}
%| label: eng-infinity
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:eng-infinity}     
\lim_{t \to \infty} e^{-at} = 0  
\end{equation}
```

But in practice, this is not the case, as its value will be very, very small after five time constants $5T$ (or $5\tau$). This is the \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\textit{Concept of Engineering Infinity}}}. The signal will never reach zero, but it will be so small that it can be considered zero for all practical purposes. This is a very important concept in control systems, as it allows us to simplify our calculations and analysis.
