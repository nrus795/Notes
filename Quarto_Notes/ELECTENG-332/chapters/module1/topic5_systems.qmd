## Topic 5: What are Systems?

### Introduction

The term *system* is derived from the Greek word *systema*, which means an organised relationship among functioning units or components. It is often used to describe any orderly arrangement of ideas or constructs.

According to the Webster's Dictionary, \\

    \begin{center}
        \textcolor{blue}{%
            \emph{``A system is an aggregation or assemblage of objects united by some form of regular interaction or interdependence; a group of diverse units so combined by nature or art as to form an integral; whole and to function, operate, or move in unison and often in obedience to some form of control\dots''}}

According to the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE),\\

        \redtext{%
            \emph{A system is an arrangement of parts or elements that together exhibit behaviour or meaning that the individual constituents do not.}}\\ The elements or parts, can include people, hardware, software, facilities, policies, and documents; that is, all things required to produce system-level results.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item It is difficult to give a single and precise definition of the term \emph{system}, which will suit to different perspectives of different people. \\
        \item In practice, what is meant by ``the system'' depends on the objectives of a particular study.\\
        \item From the control engineering perspective, \redtext{the system is any interconnection of components to achieve desired objectives.} It is characterised by its \bluetext{\textbf{inputs}}, \bluetext{\textbf{outputs}}, and the rules of operations or laws. For example:
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item[\bluetext{a.}] The laws of operation in electrical systems are Ohm's law, which gives the voltage-current relationships for resistors, capacitors and inductors, and Kirchhoff's laws, which govern the laws of interconnection of various electrical components.
                  \item[\bluetext{b.}] Similarly, in mechanical systems, the laws of operation are Newton's laws. These laws can be used to derive mathematical models of the system.
              \end{itemize}

### The System as an Operator
```{=latex}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=boxbodycol,colframe=boxheadcol,title=\textcolor{red}{\textbf{The System Operator}}]    
A system is defined mathematically \textcolor{red}{as a transformation which maps an input signal \(x(t)\) to an output signal \(y(t)\)}. For a continuous time system, the input-output mapping is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:system-operator-def-equation}
    \textcolor{red}{y(t) = \mathcal{S}[x(t)]}, \quad \text{where} \; \mathcal{S} \; \text{is an operator.}
\end{equation}
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[auto, thick, node distance=3cm, >=Latex]
        \node (input) at (0,0) {};
        \node [draw=borderblue, rectangle, minimum height=2em, minimum width=3em, right=of input] (system) {\large \(\mathcal{S}\)};
        \node [right=of system] (output) {};
        \draw [->] (input) -- node[above,midway] {\small\(x(t)\)} (system);
        \draw [->] (system) -- node[above,midway] {\small\(y(t) = \mathcal{S}[x(t)]\)} (output);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\redtext{%
        A control system may be defined as an interconnection of components which are configured to provide a desired response.}
