## Learning Outcomes {.unnumbered}

After completing this module, you should be able to:

1. Compute the static error constants of linear unity feedback systems.

2. Determine the steady state error due to standard test inputs such as step, ramp and parabolic signals.

3. Could compute the steady state error due to disturbances.

4. Could compute the steady state error for non-unity feedback systems.

## Steady State Error (SSE)

**What is Steady State Error and what is its significance?**

Steady state error refers to the discrepancy between the desired reference input and the actual output of a given control system once the system has settled into a steady condition. It serves as a metric for assessing the system's ability to accurately track the desired reference signal over time. This is especially important when it comes to PID controllers, where the goal is to minimize the steady state error to ensure the system's output closely follows the desired reference input. 

### Factors Contributing to SSE

The steady state error of a control system can be influenced by several factors, including:

1. **Imperfect Modeling**
Errors in the mathematical models used to design the control system can lead to inaccuracies in predicting the system's response, resulting in steady-state errors.

2. **Disturbances and Noise**
External disturbances or noise in the system can perturb the system's response, causing deviations from the desired reference signal in the steady state.

3. **Limitations in Control Algorithm**
Imperfections or simplifications in the control algorithm, such as linearization or approximation, can introduce errors, especially in the steady state.

4. **Nonlinear Characteristics**
Nonlinearities inherent in control system elements, such as friction, dead zones, or saturation in actuators, can result in deviations from the desired response, particularly in the steady state.

5. **Actuator Saturation**
Limitations on the maximum output of actuators, such as motors or valves, can lead to saturation effects that prevent the system from fully tracking the reference signal.

6. **Sensor Noise**
Measurement noise or inaccuracies in sensors can introduce errors into the feedback loop, affecting the control system's ability to accurately track the reference signal.

7. **Bandwidth Constraints**
Limited bandwidth in the system components, such as filters or communication channels, can affect the system's ability to respond quickly to changes in the reference signal, leading to steady-state errors.

### Steady State Error in Unity Feedback Systems

Consider a unity feedback system shown below

<!-- ! add later, too much info not enough time -->

The closed loop transfer function is given by

$$
	\dfrac{C(s)}{R(s)} = \dfrac{G(s)}{1+G(s)}
$$

The error $E(s)$ between the input $R(s)$ (reference signal), and the output, $C(s)$, is given by

$$
	E(s) = R(s) - C(s) = R(s) - G(s)E(s); \qquad \because C(s) = G(s)E(s)
$$

Solving for $E(s)$ gives

$$
	E(s) = \dfrac{R(s)}{1+G(s)}
$$

The steady state error $e_{ss}$ of a feedback control system is defined as the error when time reaches infinity. Thus
$$
	e_{ss} = e(\infty) = \lim_{t \to \infty} e(t)
$$
By applying the final value theorem, the steady state error is computed from

$$
\begin{aligned}
	e_{ss} = e(\infty) &= \lim_{t \to \infty} e(t) \\
	&= \lim_{s \to 0} sE(s) = \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{sR(s)}{1+G(s)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus the steady state error is expressed as

$$
	\textcolor{red}{e(\infty) = \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{sR(s)}{1+G(s)}}
$$

This shows that the steady state error depends on the reference input $R(s)$ as well as on the form of the transfer function $G(s)$.

## Classification of Control Systems: System TYPE

Control systems may be classified according to their ability to follow step inputs, ramp inputs, parabolic inputs, and so on. This is a reasonable classification scheme because inputs may frequently be considered combinations of such inputs. The magnitudes of the steady-state errors due to these individual inputs are indicative of the "goodness" of the system.

Consider a unity feedback control system shown in the Figure.

<!-- ! add figure later, too much info not enough time -->

The open loop transfer function of the system is described by:

$$
	G(s) = \dfrac{K(s+z_1)(s+z_2) \ldots (s+z_m)}{s^N(s+p_1)(s+p_2) \ldots (s+p_n)}
$$

This involves a term $s^N$ in the denominator, representing a pole of multiplicity (i.e. order) $N$ at the origin. This also implies the number of pure integrators present in the forward path. The present classification scheme is based on the number of pure integrators present in the forward path.

1. If the number of integrators present in the forward path is zero (i.e. $N=0$), the system is classified as a [**Type-0 System**]{color=red}.

2. Similarly, if the number of integrators present in the forward path is one (i.e. $N=1$), the system is classified as a [**Type-1 System**]{color=red}.

3. In general, if the number of integrators present in the forward path is $N$, the system is classified as a [**Type-N System**]{color=red}.

Note that as the type number is increased, accuracy is improved; however, increasing the type number aggravates the stability problem. A compromise between steady-state accuracy and relative stability is always necessary.

## Static Error Constants

The static error constants defined in the following are figures of merit of control systems from the perspective of steady state error. The **higher the value of these constants**, the **smaller the steady state error is**. 

Note that the steady state error exhibited by a system is dependant on the **Nature of the input**.

In the following, we define three static error constants such as **Position Error Constant** $K_p$, **Velocity Error Constant** $K_v$ and the **Acceleration Error Constant** $K_a$ when the input of the system is step, ramp or parabolic respectively.

### Static Position Error Constant $K_p$

This is calculated when the input signal is [a unit step signal]{color=blue}.

$$
	r(t) = 1(t)\qcomma \implies R(s) = \dfrac{1}{s}
$$

The steady state error due to this input is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
	e(\infty) &= \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{sR(s)}{1+G(s)} = \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{s}{1+G(s)} \dfrac{1}{s} \\
	&= \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{1}{1+G(s)} = \dfrac{1}{1+ \lim\limits_{s \to 0} G(s)}
\end{aligned}
$$

The [static position error constant]{color=blue} $\textcolor{blue}{K_p}$, is defined as

$$
	\textcolor{red}{K_p = \lim_{s \to 0} G(s) = G(0)}
$$

Thus, the steady state error [due to a unit step input]{color=blue} is given by

$$
	\textcolor{red}{e(\infty) = \dfrac{1}{1+K_p}; \quad K_p = \lim_{s \to 0} G(s)}
$$

### Static Position Error Constant $K_p$ for different system types

For a Type-0 system, the static position error constant is given by

$$
	K_p = \lim_{s \to 0} G(s) = \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{K(s+z_1)(s+z_2) \ldots (s+z_m)}{(s+p_1)(s+p_2) \ldots (s+p_n)} = \dfrac{K z_1 z_2 \ldots z_m}{p_1 p_2 \ldots p_n} = K_1 \text{(say)} 
$$

For a Type-1 or higher Type system, $N \geq 1$, the static position error constant is given by

$$
	K_p = \lim_{s \to 0} G(s) = \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{K(s+z_1)(s+z_2) \ldots (s+z_m)}{s^N(s+p_1)(s+p_2) \ldots (s+p_n)} = \textcolor{red}{\infty}\qcomma N \geq 1
$$

Hence, for a Type-0 system, the static position error constant $K_p$ has a finite value, whereas for a Type-1 or higher system, $K_p$ is infinite.

Summary: The steady state error $e_{ss}$ for a unit-step input:
$$
	\textcolor{red}{e_{ss} = \dfrac{1}{K_1} \qcomma \text{for Type-0 System}}
$$

$$
	\textcolor{red}{e_{ss} = 0 \qcomma \text{for Type-1 or higher System}}
$$

### Static Velocity Error Constant $K_v$

This is calculated when the input signal is [a unit ramp signal]{color=blue}

$$
	\textcolor{red}{r(t) = t\qcomma \implies R(s) = \dfrac{1}{s^2}}
$$

The steady state error due to this input is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
	e(\infty) &= \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{sR(s)}{1+G(s)} = \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{s}{1+G(s)} \dfrac{1}{s^2} \\
	&= \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{1}{s+sG(s)} = \dfrac{1}{\lim\limits_{s \to 0} sG(s)}
\end{aligned}
$$

The [static velocity error constant]{color=blue} $\textcolor{blue}{K_v}$, is defined by

$$
	\textcolor{red}{K_v = \lim_{s \to 0} sG(s)}
$$

Thus, the steady state error [due to a unit ramp input]{color=blue} is given as

$$
	\textcolor{red}{e(\infty) = \dfrac{1}{K_v}; \quad K_v = \lim_{s \to 0} sG(s)}
$$

### Static Velocity Error Constant $K_v$ for different system types

For a Type-0 system, the static velocity error constant is given by

$$
	K_v = \lim_{s \to 0} sG(s) = \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{sK(s+z_1)(s+z_2)\ldots(s+z_m)}{s(s+p_1)(s+p_2)\ldots(s+p_n)} = \textcolor{red}{0}
$$

For a Type-1 system, the static velocity error constant is given by

$$
	K_v = \lim_{s \to 0} sG(s) = \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{K(s+z_1)(s+z_2)\ldots(s+z_m)}{s(s+p_1)(s+p_2)\ldots(s+p_n)} = \dfrac{Kz_1z_2\ldots z_m}{p_1p_2\ldots p_n} = K_1 \text{(say)}
$$

For a Type-2 or higher type system, $N \geq 2$, the static velocity error constant is given by

$$
	K_v = \lim_{s \to 0} sG(s) = \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{K(s+z_1)(s+z_2)\ldots(s+z_m)}{s^N(s+p_1)(s+p_2)\ldots(s+p_n)} = \textcolor{red}{\infty}, \quad N \geq 2
$$

Summary: The steady state error $e_{ss}$, for a unit ramp input:

$$
	\textcolor{red}{e_{ss} = \dfrac{1}{K_v}=\infty\qcomma \text{for Type-0 System}}
$$

$$
	\textcolor{red}{e_{ss} = \dfrac{1}{K_v} = \dfrac{1}{K_1}\qcomma \text{for Type-1 System}}
$$

$$
	\textcolor{red}{e_{ss}=0\qcomma \text{for Type-2 or higher System}}
$$

### Static Acceleration Error Constant $K_a$

This is calculated when the input signal is [a unit parabolic signal]{color=blue}

$$
	\textcolor{red}{r(t) = \dfrac{t^2}{2}\qcomma \forall t \geq 0\qcomma r(t) = 0\qcomma \forall t < 0 \quad \implies \quad R(s) = \dfrac{1}{s^3}}
$$

The steady state error due to this input is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
	e(\infty) &= \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{sR(s)}{1+G(s)} = \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{s}{1+G(s)} \dfrac{1}{s^3} \\
	&= \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{1}{s^2+s^2G(s)} = \dfrac{1}{\lim\limits_{s \to 0} s^2G(s)}
\end{aligned}
$$

The [static acceleration error constant]{color=blue} $\textcolor{blue}{K_a}$, is defined by

$$
	\textcolor{red}{K_a = \lim_{s \to 0} s^2 G(s)}
$$

Summary: The steady state error $e_{ss}$, due to a unit parabolic input:

$$
	\textcolor{red}{e(\infty) = \dfrac{1}{K_a}; \quad K_a = \lim_{s \to 0} s^2G(s)}
$$

### Static Acceleration Error Constant $K_a$ for different system types

For a Type-0 system, the static acceleration error constant is given by

$$
	K_a = \lim_{s \to 0} s^2G(s) = \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{s^2K(s+z_1)(s+z_2)\ldots(s+z_m)}{s(s+p_1)(s+p_2)\ldots(s+p_n)} = \textcolor{red}{0}
$$

For a Type-1 system, the static acceleration error constant is given by

$$
	K_a = \lim_{s \to 0} s^2G(s) = \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{s^2K(s+z_1)(s+z_2)\ldots(s+z_m)}{s(s+p_1)(s+p_2)\ldots(s+p_n)} = \textcolor{red}{0}
$$

For a Type-2 system, the static acceleration error constant is given by

$$
	K_a = \lim_{s \to 0} s^2G(s) = \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{s^2K(s+z_1)(s+z_2)\ldots(s+z_m)}{s^2(s+p_1)(s+p_2)\ldots(s+p_n)} = \dfrac{Kz_1z_2\ldots z_m}{p_1p_2\ldots p_n} = K_1 \text{(say)}
$$

For a Type-3 or higher type system, $N \geq 3$, the static acceleration error constant is given by

$$
	K_a = \lim_{s \to 0} s^2G(s) = \lim_{s \to 0} \dfrac{s^2K(s+z_1)(s+z_2)\ldots(s+z_m)}{s^N(s+p_1)(s+p_2)\ldots(s+p_n)} = \textcolor{red}{\infty}\qcomma N \geq 3
$$

Summary: The steady state error $e_{ss}$, for a unit parabolic input:

$$
	\textcolor{red}{e_{ss} = \dfrac{1}{K_a} = \infty \qcomma \text{for Type-0 and Type-1 Systems}}
$$

$$
	\textcolor{red}{e_{ss} = \dfrac{1}{K_a} = \dfrac{1}{K_1}\qcomma \text{for Type-2 System}}
