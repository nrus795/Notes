# Frequency Domain Analysis of Linear Systems

## Learning Outcomes {.unnumbered}

After completing this module, you should be able to:

- Analytically compute the frequency response of a second order system

- Determine various frequency domain specifications such as bandwidth, resonant frequency etc.

- Correlate the frequency domain specifications with time domain response.

## What is the Frequency Response of a System?

The frequency Response of a system is the steady state response of the system to a sinusoidal input. 

Define: Frequency Range, Amplitude

1. Apply one frequency

2. Study resulting response to make a valid amplitude and phase

3. Repeat with another frequency


For linear systems, the frequency of input and output signals remains the same. i.e. in linear systems, energy transfer from input to output occurs at the **same frequency**, while the ratio of magnitude of output signal to the input signal and the phase between the two signals may change.

## Root Locus Method vs. Frequency Response Method

:::{#first-column}
**Advantages of the Root Locus Method:**

- Good indicator of transient response
- Explicitly shows location of all closed-loop poles
- Trade-offs in the design are fairly clear

:::

**Disadvantages of the Root Locus Method:**

- Requires a transfer function model (poles and zeros);
- Difficult to infer all performance metrics;
- Hard to determine response to steady-state (sinusoids)
- Hard to infer stability margins

**Advantages of the Frequency Response Method:**

- Frequency response methods are a good complement to the root locus techniques
- Can infer performance and stability from the same plot
- Can use measured data rather than a transfer function model
- Design process can be independent of the system order
- Time delays are handled correctly
- Graphical techniques (analysis and synthesis) are quite simple
