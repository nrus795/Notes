{"title":"COMPSYS 304: Computer Architecture","markdown":{"headingText":"Introduction","headingAttr":{"id":"","classes":["unnumbered"],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThese notes are compiled from the lectures of COMPSYS 304. They are intended as a personal reference to help with assignments, exam preparation, and understanding key concepts in Computer Architecture.\n\nThe notes are organised by lecture and cover a wide range of topics from basic computer architecture principles to more advanced subjects like MIPS implementation and performance analysis. Feel free to add personal insights, additional readings, or questions as you review this material.\n\n## Organisation of the Notes {.unnumbered}\n\nThe notes are divided by lecture content, with each section corresponding to a specific set of topics. Here’s how they’re organized:\n\n-   **Lecture 1-3: Basics of Computer Architecture**\\\n    Key topics include Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), memory hierarchy, and basic CPU organisation.\n\n-   **Lecture 4-6: MIPS Architecture**\\\n    Covers the MIPS instruction set, control flow, and subroutine handling.\n\n-   **Lecture 7-9: CPU Implementation**\\\n    Focuses on different methods for implementing CPUs and the trade-offs involved.\n\n-   **Lecture 10-12: Digital Circuits and Datapath Design**\\\n    Reviews fundamental digital circuit concepts and discusses the design of a MIPS datapath.\n\n-   **Lecture 13-15: Performance Analysis**\\\n    Provides an in-depth look at how different design choices impact CPU performance.\n\n## How I Use These Notes {.unnumbered}\n\nThese notes are a living document, and I intend to update them as I gain a deeper understanding of the material. Here’s how I use them:\n\n-   **Quick Reference**: For quick lookups, the Table of Contents will help me jump directly to the relevant section.\n-   **In-Depth Study**: For exam preparation, I’ll revisit each section, ensuring I understand each concept before moving on.\n-   **Personal Insights**: I’ll be adding my own thoughts, additional notes from readings, and potential questions for further study.\n\nI might also include exercises or practical examples that help solidify my understanding of the more complex topics.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"pdf":{"identifier":{"display-name":"PDF","target-format":"pdf","base-format":"pdf"},"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":true,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":true,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"latexmk","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","include-in-header":["preamble.tex"],"filters":["color-filter","latex-environment"],"pdf-engine-opts":["-synctex=1","-interaction=nonstopmode","-file-line-error","-lualatex","-shell-escape"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"index.pdf"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
