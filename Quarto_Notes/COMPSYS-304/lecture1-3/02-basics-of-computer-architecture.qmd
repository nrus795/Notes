## What is Computer Architecture?

<!-- Mermaid diagram showing same figure from notes -->

-   **ISA:** The programmer-visible instructions â€” ISA serves as the boundary between the hardware and software.

-   **Organization:** high-level aspects of computer design (e.g. the internal design of the CPU, the memory system, the interconnection structure, ...)

-   **Hardware:** detailed logic design, circuit-level design, packaging technology, etc.

## Review: Memory Organization

<!-- Memory Diagram to left of list -->

-   Memory is viewed as a large, one-dimensional array, which has an address range.

-   A memory address is an index into the array

-   The index usually points to a byte of memory.

-   To access a larger word (e.g., a 32-bit word or 4 bytes), four consecutive memory locations are accessed.

*Memory access time* is the amount of time required to read (usually one byte) or write data (usually one byte) from/to memory.

::: {#MemVsCPUSpeed}
## An Overview of Memory Speed vs. CPU Speed

The rate of memory speed increase has been less than processors speed increase

<!-- CPU-Z memory access latency graph align left -->

Fast memory is more expensive per bit than slow memory, so a **memory hierarchy** is often used to give a performance close to the fastest memory with a lower average cost per bit.
