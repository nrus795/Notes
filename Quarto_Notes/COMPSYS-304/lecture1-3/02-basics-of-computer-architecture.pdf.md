This chapter begins the journey into the content of this course.

## What is Computer Architecture?

-   **ISA:** The programmer-visible instructions â€” ISA serves as the boundary between the hardware and software.

-   **Organization:** high-level aspects of computer design (e.g. the internal design of the CPU, the memory system, the interconnection structure, ...)

-   **Hardware:** detailed logic design, circuit-level design, packaging technology, etc.

## Review: Memory Organization

-   Memory is viewed as a large, one-dimensional array, which has an address range.

-   A memory address is an index into the array

-   The index usually points to a byte of memory.

-   To access a larger word (e.g., a 32-bit word or 4 bytes), four consecutive memory locations are accessed.

*Memory access time* is the amount of time required to read (usually one byte) or write data (usually one byte) from/to memory.

## An Overview of Memory Speed vs. CPU Speed

The rate of memory speed increase has been less than processors speed increase

Fast memory is more expensive per bit than slow memory, so a **memory hierarchy** is often used to give a performance close to the fastest memory with a lower average cost per bit.
