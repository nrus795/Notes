# Embedded Processors

## Introduction to Embedded Processors

Embedded processors are specialized computation engines designed to implement a system's desired functionality. Unlike general-purpose processors, embedded processors can be optimized for specific applications, balancing performance, power consumption, and area constraints (Slide 5). There are three main types of embedded processors: **general-purpose processors**, **single-purpose processors**, and **application-specific processors**. Each has its advantages and trade-offs, depending on the intended application.

## Types of Embedded Processors

### General-Purpose Processors

**General-purpose processors** (also known as microprocessors) are programmable devices used in a wide variety of applications. They contain a **program memory**, a **datapath** with a large register file, and a **general ALU** (Slide 7). Some notable features include:

-   **High Flexibility**: General-purpose processors can run different software programs, making them highly adaptable.

-   **Low Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) Costs**: These processors can be developed for a broad market, leading to lower initial costs.

-   **Examples**: The **Pentium** processor is a well-known example, but there are many other general-purpose processors used in embedded systems.

General-purpose processors are ideal for systems that need versatility but do not have extreme performance or power constraints.

### Single-Purpose Processors

**Single-purpose processors** are digital circuits designed to execute only one specific program, such as a **coprocessor**, **accelerator**, or **peripheral** (Slide 8). Key characteristics include:

-   **Minimal Components**: They contain only the elements necessary for their task, often without program memory, which reduces size and power consumption.

-   **Benefits**: Single-purpose processors are **fast**, **small**, and **low power** due to their dedicated nature. Since there are no extra components, they achieve high efficiency in both speed and energy.

-   **Examples**: Hardware implementations of functions like **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** are often realized with single-purpose processors.

These processors are well-suited for real-time, deterministic tasks that require minimal latency and maximum energy efficiency.

### Application-Specific Processors

**Application-specific processors** are programmable processors optimized for a particular class of applications that share common characteristics (Slide 9). They combine aspects of both general-purpose and single-purpose processors:

-   **Program Memory and Optimized Datapath**: Application-specific processors include a program memory and a **customized datapath** tailored to the target applications, such as **DSPs** (Digital Signal Processors).

-   **Trade-Off**: They offer some flexibility compared to single-purpose processors, while providing better performance and efficiency than general-purpose processors.

-   **Benefits**: These processors provide a balance of flexibility, performance, size, and power consumption, making them ideal for use in systems that need customization without sacrificing too much generalizability.

## Finite-State Machine with Datapath (FSMD)

One of the most common approaches in custom embedded processor design is the use of a **Finite-State Machine with Datapath (FSMD)**. FSMD is a model that integrates control and data paths, allowing complex behaviors to be implemented systematically (Slide 17).

-   **FSMD Structure**: An FSMD consists of:

    -   **Controller**: A finite-state machine that determines the sequence of operations.

    -   **Datapath**: Composed of **registers**, **ALUs**, and **other functional units** used to manipulate data (Slide 19).

**Design Flow**: Typically, a design starts by creating an algorithm, converting it to a state machine, and then mapping it to an FSMD (Slide 18). This involves defining states, transitions, and operations that control how data is processed.

-   **Example: GCD Calculation**: The **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** example demonstrated in the lecture involves defining a simple algorithm and converting it to an FSMD. The states of the GCD FSM correspond to different stages of the computation, and the datapath manages the subtraction operations required to compute the GCD (Slide 17).

## Custom Processor Design Techniques

The design of custom embedded processors involves several key techniques for optimizing performance, size, and power:

-   **Datapath Design**: Involves creating registers for each declared variable and functional units for each arithmetic operation (Slide 19). The registers, ALU, and functional units are connected based on the data flow in the original algorithm.

-   **Controller Design**: The controller is responsible for sequencing the operations in the datapath. Complex actions in the FSMD are broken down into manageable control steps to ensure deterministic behavior (Slide 20).

-   **Splitting into Controller and Datapath**: Splitting the controller and datapath allows for better modularity and optimization of the design. The controller handles decision-making, while the datapath focuses on arithmetic and logical operations (Slide 21).

## Optimization Strategies for Embedded Processors

**Optimization** is the process of refining the design to achieve the best possible trade-off among different design metrics, such as speed, area, and power consumption (Slide 24).

-   **Program Optimization**: Involves analyzing the original program for inefficiencies. The use of more efficient arithmetic operations or changing the sequence of operations can significantly improve the overall performance. For example, replacing subtraction operations with modulo in the GCD algorithm sped up the calculation and reduced loop iterations (Slide 26).

-   **FSMD Optimization**: The FSMD can be optimized by merging or separating states to improve efficiency (Slide 27). **State merging** can be done for states with constant transitions, whereas **state separation** can help reduce hardware complexity for states requiring complex operations.

-   **Datapath Optimization**: **Sharing functional units** between states can reduce the area by avoiding redundant hardware. **Multi-functional units** like ALUs can be used for different operations in different states, optimizing resource usage (Slide 29).

-   **FSM Optimization**: Optimizing the finite-state machine involves techniques like **state encoding** (assigning efficient binary codes to states) and **state minimization** (merging equivalent states to reduce complexity) (Slide 30).

## Custom Single-Purpose Processor Design: An Example

The lecture provided an example of designing a custom single-purpose processor for a simple **bridge** that converts two 4-bit inputs into an 8-bit output (Slide 31).

-   **RT-Level Design**: The Register-Transfer (RT) level model is used to specify how data is transferred and manipulated in each clock cycle. The design includes both a **controller FSM** and a **datapath** with registers and functional units (Slide 32).

-   **State Diagram and Data Flow**: The RT-level processor's behavior is defined through state diagrams and data flow diagrams, demonstrating how each input is processed and combined into an output. The controller is responsible for sequencing these operations, while the datapath handles the actual data manipulation.

## C to Hardware: Synthesis and Implementation

Another important aspect covered in the lecture was the conversion from **C code to hardware**. This is known as **High-Level Synthesis (HLS)** and is used to automatically convert behavioral C code into corresponding hardware designs (Slide 14).

-   **Motivation**: The main advantage is achieving maximum performance for specific applications without having to manually write hardware descriptions in HDL (Hardware Description Language). This approach allows software developers to leverage existing C code and translate it into efficient hardware implementations.

-   **Components**: The translation involves identifying data and control instructions and converting them into datapath elements like **ALUs**, **registers**, and **control logic**. This is then used to create a hardware implementation of the algorithm specified in C (Slide 15).

## Evolution of Embedded Processors

Embedded processors have evolved significantly to meet the demands of modern applications (Slide 10).

-   **Single-Purpose to Application-Specific Processors**: Initially, systems relied on **single-purpose processors** for dedicated tasks. These processors provided efficient solutions but lacked flexibility.

-   **Application-Specific Processors**: As the complexity of embedded applications increased, the need for processors that strike a balance between performance and flexibility led to the development of **application-specific processors**. These processors retain the programmability of general-purpose processors while including optimizations for particular tasks.

-   **Customizable Processors**: Modern approaches include the use of **customizable processors** that allow designers to optimize hardware for a specific application domain without losing the general flexibility of programmable processors.

## Conclusion

The lecture provided a comprehensive overview of **embedded processors** and their role in implementing complex systems. Custom embedded processors, including general-purpose, single-purpose, and application-specific types, each have their unique trade-offs. Techniques such as **FSMD modeling**, **controller and datapath splitting**, and **high-level synthesis** were introduced to demonstrate the design and optimization of these processors.

Future discussions will delve deeper into **real-time constraints**, **hardware-software co-design**, and techniques for optimizing **multi-core embedded systems** to meet stringent performance and power requirements. Understanding these concepts is essential for designing embedded processors that can efficiently address the challenges posed by modern applications.
