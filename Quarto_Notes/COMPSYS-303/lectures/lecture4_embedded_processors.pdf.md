# Lecture 4: Embedded Processors

## Overview
- **Custom Processor Design**: Embedded systems often require specialized processors designed specifically for the application to ensure optimal performance and efficiency.
- **FSMD (Finite State Machine with Datapath)**: A model that integrates a finite state machine (FSM) with a datapath to execute instructions in an embedded system.
- **Datapath Design**: Consists of elements like registers, ALUs, and multiplexers that perform arithmetic operations and manage data flow.
- **Controller Design**: Controls the sequence of operations performed by the datapath, ensuring synchronization between different components.

## Types of Processors
- **General-Purpose Processors**: Flexible and programmable, used for a wide variety of applications. Example: Pentium processors.
- **Single-Purpose Processors**: Designed to execute one specific program efficiently. Example: Accelerators or coprocessors for specialized tasks.
- **Application-Specific Processors**: A compromise between general-purpose and single-purpose processors, optimized for a particular class of applications to balance flexibility, performance, and power consumption.

## C to Hardware Synthesis
- **Hardware Synthesis from C Code**: Converting high-level C code to hardware involves inferring control and data paths from program logic. This approach allows designers to achieve maximum performance for specific applications without manually coding in HDL.

## FSMD Design
- **State Diagram Templates**: Used to model control flow in the FSMD, involving components like loops, branches, and assignments.
- **Datapath Creation**: Involves creating registers for variables, functional units for operations, and interconnecting them with control signals to create a functional system.
- **Controller FSM**: Works with the datapath to manage control flow and determine which operations are executed at each step.

## Example: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
- **GCD Implementation**: Demonstrates how an algorithm (finding the GCD of two numbers) can be converted into an FSMD with a state diagram representing the control flow and a datapath for arithmetic operations.
