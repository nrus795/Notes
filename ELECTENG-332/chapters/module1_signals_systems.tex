\section{Topic 1: Importance of Exponential Functions}
The Exponential function, written as either
\(e^{ax}\) or \(e^{at}\) depending on whether it is \(f(t)\) or \(f(x)\),
has properties that make it mathematically unique.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The derivative (rate of change) of the exponential function is the exponential function itself. More generally, this is a function whose rate of change is proportional to the function itself.
          \[
              \od{e^{ax}}{x} = ae^{ax}
          \]
    \item The integral of the exponential function is also the exponential function itself.
          \[
              \int e^{ax} \dif x = \frac{1}{a}e^{ax}
          \]
\end{enumerate}

\section{Topic 2: Concept of Engineering Infinity}
Consider a signal \(e^{-at}\). The time constant for this signal is \(T = \frac{1}{a}\). Theoretically, the signal is meant to decay to zero as time approaches infinity, i.e.
\[ 
    \lim_{t \to \infty} e^{-at} = 0 
\]
But in practice, this is not the case, as its value will be very, very small after five time constants \(5T\). This is the \emph{Concept of Engineering Infinity}.

\section{Topic 3: Concept of Complex Frequency}
Complex frequency is found commonly in electrical engineering. It is often notated as \( j\omega \) or \( s = \sigma \pm j \omega \). These frequencies always come in pairs, so the use of \( \pm \) is implicit to this, as complex numbers have complex conjugates, i.e.
\(s = \sigma + j \omega \) has the conjugate \(s = \sigma - j\omega \).

\noindent This is also backed up by De Moivre's Formula, which is defined mathematically as:
\begin{gather*}
    \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \quad \forall n \in \mathbb{Z}, \\
    e^{j n x} = \cos(n x) + j \sin(n x)
\end{gather*}
Or more generally for our applications:
\begin{gather*}
    e^{jx} = \cos(x) + j\sin(x) \\
    \text{Where} \, x \in \mathbb{R}\, \text{(\(x\) is Real)} \\
    \text{and} \, j \equiv i = \sqrt{-1}.
\end{gather*}

\section{Topic 4: What are Signals?}
It is difficult to find a unique definition of a signal. However in the context of this course, we give a workable definition which suits most of our purposes as:

    \vspace{-1em}\caption{Definition of a Signal}
\end{figure}

\noindent Examples of such signals include: Voltage, current, speech, television, images from remote space probes, voltages generated by the heart and brain, radar and sonar echoes, seismic vibrations, signals from GPS satellites, signals from human genes, and countless other applications.

\vspace{-1em}
\noindent The instantaneous power \(p(t)\) of a signal \(x(t)\) is expressed as:
\[
    \textcolor{red}{p(t) = x^2(t)}
\]
The total energy of a continuous-time signal \(x(t)\) is given by:
\[
    \textcolor{blue}{E = \lim_{T \to \infty} \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} x^2(t) \dif t = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2(t) \dif t}
\]
For a complex valued signal:
\[
    \textcolor{red}{E = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \abs{x(t)}^2 \dif t}
\]
Since power equals to the time average of the energy, the average power is given by:
\[
    \textcolor{blue}{P = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} x^2(t) \dif t = \frac{E}{T}}
\]
\newpage
\noindent Note that during calculation of energy, we average the power over an infinitely large interval.

\subsection{Examples}
\subsubsection{Example 1: Unit Step Function}
Consider a unit step function defined as:
\[
    \textcolor{blue}{u(t) =
        \begin{cases}
            1 & t \geq 0         \\
            0 & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}}
\]
Determine whether this is an energy signal or a power signal or neither.\\
\noindent \textbf{Solution:} Let us compute the energy of this signal as:
\[
    E = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {[u(t)]}^2 \dif t = \int_{0}^{\infty} {[0]}^2 \dif t = \int_{0}^{\infty} {[1]}^2 \dif t = \infty
\]
Since the energy of this signal is infinite, it cannot be an energy signal. Let us compute the power of this signal as:
\[
    \textcolor{blue}{P = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} {[u(t)]}^2 \dif t = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T/2} {[u(t)]}^2 \dif t = \frac{1}{2}}
\]
The power of this signal is finite. Hence,\,\textcolor{red}{this is a power signal.}

\subsubsection{Example 2: Exponential Function}
Consider an exponential function defined as:
\[
    x(t) = e^{-at}u(t), \, \text{where} \; u(t) \;\text{is the unit step signal},\, a > 0
\]
Classify this signal as an energy, power, or neither.\\
\noindent \textbf{Solution:} Let us compute the energy of this signal as:
\[
    E = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {[x(t)]}^2 \dif t = \int_{0}^{\infty} {[e^{-at}]}^2 \dif t = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-2at} \dif t = \frac{1}{2a} < \infty
\]
Thus, \(x(t) = e^{-at}u(t)\) is an \textcolor{red}{energy signal.}

\subsubsection{Example 3: Ramp Function}
Consider a ramp function defined as:
\[
    r(t) =
    \begin{cases}
        At & t \geq 0         \\
        0  & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\]
Classify this signal as an energy, power, or neither.\\
\noindent \textbf{Solution:} Let us compute the energy of this signal as:
\[
    E = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {r(t)}^2 \dif t = \int_{-\infty}^{0} {[0]}^2 \dif t = \int_{0}^{\infty} A^2 t^2 \dif t = A^2 \frac{T^3}{3} \Bigg|_{0}^{\infty} = \infty
\]
Since the energy of this signal is infinite, it cannot be an energy signal. Let us compute the power of this signal as:
\[
    P = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} {[r(t)]}^2 \dif t = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T/2} A^2 t^2 \dif t = A^2 \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \frac{T^3}{3} \Bigg|_{0}^{\infty} = \infty
\]
The power of this signal is infinite. Hence, this is \textcolor{red}{neither a power nor an energy signal.}

\section{Topic 5: What are Systems?}
The term \emph{system} is derived from the Greek word \emph{systema}, which means an organised relationship among functioning units or components. It is often used to describe any orderly arrangement of ideas or constructs.\\
According to the Webster's Dictionary,
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{mdframed}
        \begin{center}
            \textcolor{blue}{%
                \emph{``A system is an aggregation or assemblage of objects united by some form of regular interaction or interdependence; a group of diverse units so combined by nature or art as to form an integral; whole and to function, operate, or move in unison and often in obedience to some form of control\dots''}}
        \end{center}
    \end{mdframed}\label{fig:system-def-1}
    \vspace{-1em}\caption{Dictionary Definition of a System}
\end{figure}
\noindent According to the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE),
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{mdframed}
        \begin{center}
            \textcolor{red}{%
                \emph{A system is an arrangement of parts or elements that together exhibit behaviour or meaning that the individual constituents do not.}}\\ The elements or parts, can include people, hardware, software, facilities, policies, and documents; that is, all things required to produce system-level results.
        \end{center}
    \end{mdframed}\label{fig:system-def-2}
    \vspace{-1em}\caption{Definition of a System}
\end{figure}
\noindent It is difficult to give a single and precise definition of the term \emph{system}, which will suit to different perspectives of different people. In practice, what is meant by ``the system'' depends on the objectives of a particular study.\\
From the control engineering perspective, \textcolor{red}{the system is any interconnection of components to achieve desired objectives.} It is characterised by its \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{inputs}}, \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{outputs}}, and the rules of operations or laws. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textcolor{blue}{a.}] The laws of operation in electrical systems are Ohm's law, which gives the voltage-current relationships for resistors, capacitors and inductors, and Kirchhoff's laws, which govern the laws of interconnection of various electrical components.
    \item[\textcolor{blue}{b.}] Similarly, in mechanical systems, the laws of operation are Newton's laws. These laws can be used to derive mathematical models of the system.
