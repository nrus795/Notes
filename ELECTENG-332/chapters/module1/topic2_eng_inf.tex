\section{Topic 2: Concept of Engineering Infinity}
Consider a signal \(e^{-at}\). The time constant for this signal is \(T = \frac{1}{a}\). Theoretically, the signal is meant to decay to zero as time approaches infinity, i.e.
\[ 
    \lim_{t \to \infty} e^{-at} = 0 
\]
But in practice, this is not the case, as its value will be very, very small after five time constants \(5T\). This is the \emph{Concept of Engineering Infinity}.
